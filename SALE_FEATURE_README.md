## How to Use

### For Admins

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel**: Access `/admin` page (requires admin privileges)
2. **View Products**: See all products in the Products table
3. **Apply Sale**: Click "Apply Sale" button for any product
4. **Set Parameters**:
   - Enter sale percentage (1-100%)
   - Select sale end date (must be in the future)
5. **Confirm**: Click "Apply Sale" to activate the discount

### Sale Management

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
- Added `salePercentage` field (0-100, default 0)
- Added `saleEndDate` field (Date, default null)
- Virtual fields for `salePrice` and `isOnSale`

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/products/sale` - Apply/update sale information

### Frontend Components
- Updated Product model with sale fields
- Enhanced admin panel with sale controls
- Modified product display to show sale prices
- Updated payment processing to use sale prices

## Sale Logic

- Sale is active when `salePercentage > 0` AND `saleEndDate > current date`
- Sale price = `originalPrice * (100 - salePercentage) / 100`
- Automatic expiration when end date is reached
- Sale prices are rounded to 2 decimal places

## Validation

- Sale percentage must be between 1-100%
- Sale end date must be in the future
- All fields are required when applying a sale
- Automatic cleanup of expired sales

## User Interface

### Admin Panel
- Sale column in products table
- Sale modal with percentage and date inputs
- Success/error messages
- Visual indicators for active sales

### Product Display
- Original price (crossed out)
- Sale price (highlighted in red)
- Sale badge showing discount percentage
- Consistent styling across all product views

## Security

- Input validation on both frontend and backend
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- No direct database manipulation from frontend

## Future Enhancements

- Sale analytics and reporting
